/* 695. Max Area of Island */
/** Given a non-empty 2D array grid of 0's and 1's, an island is a group of 1's 
 *  (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) 
 *  You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
 *  Find the maximum area of an island in the given 2D array. (If there is no island, the maximum area is 0.)
 * 
 *  Example 1:
 *  [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
 *   [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 *   [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 *   [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
 *   [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
 *   [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
 *   [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 *   [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
 *  Given the above grid, return 6. Note the answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
 *  
 *  Example 2:
 *  [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
 *  Given the above grid, return 0.
 *  Note: The length of each dimension in the given grid does not exceed 50. */
