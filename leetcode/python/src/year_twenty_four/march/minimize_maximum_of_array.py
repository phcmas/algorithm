2439. Minimize Maximum of Array
You are given a 0-indexed array nums comprising of n non-negative integers.
In one operation, you must:

Choose an integer i such that 1 <= i < n and nums[i] > 0.
Decrease nums[i] by 1.
Increase nums[i - 1] by 1.
Return the minimum possible value of the maximum integer of nums after performing any number of operations.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,7,1,6]
Output: 5
Explanation:
One set of optimal operations is as follows:
1. Choose i = 1, and nums becomes [4,6,1,6].
2. Choose i = 3, and nums becomes [4,6,2,5].
3. Choose i = 1, and nums becomes [5,5,2,5].
The maximum integer of nums is 5. It can be shown that the maximum number cannot be less than 5.
Therefore, we return 5.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [10,1]
Output: 10
Explanation:
It is optimal to leave nums as is, and since 10 is the maximum value, we return 10.

Constraints:
n == nums.length
2 <= n <= 10^5
0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
