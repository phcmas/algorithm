1002. Find Common Characters

Given a string array words, return an array of all characters that show up in all strings
within the words (including duplicates). You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: words = ["bella","label","roller"]
Output: ["e","l","l"]

Example 2:
Input: words = ["cool","lock","cook"]
Output: ["c","o"]

Constraints:
1 <= words.length <= 100
1 <= words[i].length <= 100
words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
